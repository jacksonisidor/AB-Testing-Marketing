# A/B Testing on Marketing Strategies

## Goal
The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of two marketing strategies and provide a thorough recommendation on how to move forward.

## Overview
This repository contains a detailed data science project that analyzes marketing campaigns using various data science skills, including preprocessing, visualization, and hypothesis testing. Throughout the project, there were instances where unexpected results in visualizations and deviations from planned hypothesis tests led to adaptions in the analysis. This attention to detail was crucial in producing a robust recommendation based on precise and comprehensive analysis.
